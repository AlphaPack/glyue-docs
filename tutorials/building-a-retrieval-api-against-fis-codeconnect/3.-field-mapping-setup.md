# Field Mapping Setup

**Setting up the Field Mapping Table**\
\
Right click on the service you just created and Go To -> Field Mapping. This page should be blank.\
\
From here, you'll want to add 3 different rows. The number of field mapping rows that are required for a specific service vary, but for this example we will need 3 distinct rows.\
\
Number each Sequence column for each row from 1 to 3. Under the "Field" column for each row, enter the following into each one:\
\
\- `_application_id`\
\- `_path`\
\- `_method`\
\
The "Value" column of each of these rows also needs to be filled in. For each of the Field columns, use the following matrix to determine what should go inside the value column:\


| Field             | Value                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `_application_id` | "CI"                          |
| `_path`           | f"customers/{customerNumber}" |
| `_method`         | "GET"                         |

\
Ensure that the "Value Type" column for each of these rows is set to `str` which stands for the data type "String".\
\
Save the changes that you've added.
