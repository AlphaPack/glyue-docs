# 3. Running the Integration

In the previous two steps, we added the configuration information for our mock banking core, and set up a Service Request to map the received data from `randomuser.me` to the format expected by the mock banking core.

Now we can run the integration and see the new user created in the mock banking core.

First, open the [mock banking core](https://sandbox.demo-systems.sandboxbanking.com) and review the list of users present.&#x20;

Return to Glyue, right click on our integration, and click _Run Integration._ Click _Execute_ on the **Integration Runner**. Verify that the integration ran successfully. Check the output of the integration and remember the name of the new user.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If your integration resulted in a failure, double check the field mappings you created in the [previous step](2.-field-mapping.md). Verify that the values are entered exactly as instructed.
{% endhint %}

Now return to the [mock banking core](https://sandbox.demo-systems.sandboxbanking.com) and refresh the page. You will now see the new user that we received from `randomuser.me` as an entry in the mock banking core.

Congratulations! :raised\_hands: You've now built an integration that connects two different systems and bridges the gap in their data formats.&#x20;

The process shown in this and the prior tutorial form the basis of building integrations in Glyue. You can extend this model to build powerful transformations, processors, and connections between an ever-growing list of third-party systems.
