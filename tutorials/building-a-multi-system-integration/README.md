# Building a Multi-System Integration

{% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial builds upon the work done in [**Build a Single-Step Integration**](../building-a-single-step-integration/)**.** If you haven't already, we recommend you complete that tutorial first, then return here.
{% endhint %}

In this tutorial, we extend the single-step integration that retrieves a user from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API by further processing the received data and sending it to a second sytem, a mock banking core.
