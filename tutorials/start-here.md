# Start Here

## Beginner Tutorials

The three tutorials presented here are intentionally sequenced, and each tutorial builds on the ones before it.&#x20;

By working through these tutorials, you will learn to navigate Glyue, build, run, and inspect the outputs of integrations, and connect Glyue to external systems.

These skills will provide the foundation for building larger, more complex integrations on Glyue. After you finish these tutorials, we recommend you learn-by-doing, using the extensive collection of How-To Guides and Reference Docs to further extend your abilities.

**Recommended Order of Tutorials:**

1. [**Building a Single-Step Integration**](building-a-single-step-integration/)**:** Learn the basics of navigating Glyue, creating an integration and service requests, and running an integration.
2. [**Building a Multi-System Integration**](building-a-multi-system-integration/)**:** Use the results of the first integration to make changes in a second system, a mock banking core.
3. [**Building an Event-Driven Integration**](building-an-event-driven-integration/)**:** Modify your integration to respond to requests from external systems.



## Advanced Tutorials

Once you have completed the first three tutorials above, we encourage you to keep exploring and learning with the following, advanced tutorials:

* [**Building an Email Integration**](building-a-basic-integration/)
* [**Building a RESTful CRUD Web Service**](building-a-restful-crud-web-service/)
* [**Building a Retrieval API with FIS Codeconnect**](building-a-customer360-retrieval-api-against-fis-codeconnect/)
