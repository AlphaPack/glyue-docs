# Summary

We use Bookmarks [bookmarks.md](bookmarks.md "mention") to group Field Mappings by category, we compare the source and target fields ( [source-and-targets.md](source-and-targets.md "mention") ) from the template and change the Status ( [field-mapping-status.md](field-mapping-status.md "mention") ) to indicate that it has been reviewed. Comments ( [field-mapping-comments.md](field-mapping-comments.md "mention") ) are used to add further details during the Pre-Mapping Process.

Pre-Mapping is considered complete when all the Field Mappings have their Statuses changed.

### FAQ

* Q: What if the template doesn't have a field mapping for a field I use?\
  A: This is taken care of during the Mapping phase
* Q: Does every Field Mapping need a comment?\
  A: No, they don't. But Comments help add context for the **In Progress** and **Waiting for Support** Statuses that will make the Mapping Phase run smoother
