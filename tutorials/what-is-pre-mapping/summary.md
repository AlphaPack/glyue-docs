# Summary

We use [**Bookmarks**](bookmarks.md) to group **Field Mappings** by category. We compare the [**Source and Target**](source-and-targets.md) from the integration framework and change the [**Status**](field-mapping-status.md) to indicate that it has been reviewed. [**Comments**](field-mapping-comments.md) are used to add further details during the **Pre-Mapping** Process.

**Pre-Mapping** is considered complete when EVERY **Field Mapping Status** has been transitioned from **Not Started** to **Needs Testing, Not Used, Waiting for Support, or Change Requested**

### FAQ

Q: What if the template doesn't have a field mapping for a field I use?\
A: Use your [Help Center](https://alphapack.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) to let your Solution Engineer know and they will add it!

Q: Does every Field Mapping need a comment?\
A: No, they don't. But Comments help add context for the **In Progress** and **Waiting for Support** Statuses that will make the Mapping Phase run smoother

Q: How much information should I provide during the Pre-Mapping Stage?\
A: As much as possible! The more information you provide during the Pre-Mapping stage, the quicker your Solution Engineer can go during the Mapping stage. Put any additional information in a Comment on the Field Mapping
