# Before you start

Since the purpose of Pre-Mapping is to review the integration template, this will likely only apply if you're using a template from our integration catalog. If the integration is being built from the ground up, check with the Sandbox Banking Project Manager, Solution Architect or Solutions Engineer to see if this phase or an equivalent applies to your project.

Here's a checklist of prerequisites you'll need for Pre-Mapping:

* Read [..](../../ "mention")first
* Access to your Glyue DEV environment
* Full permissions to the integration in your environment
* Access to your [Glyue Help Center (Jira Portal)](https://alphapack.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're missing any of the above prerequisites or are unsure if you have all of them, submit a ticket in the [Glyue Help Center](https://alphapack.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
{% endhint %}
