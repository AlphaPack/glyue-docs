# Bookmarks

The **Bookmarks Page** is where you'll find the set of bookmarks for your organization. Much like the bookmarks in your browser, **Bookmarks** in Glyue are simply a link to a specific location in Glyue. **Bookmarks** can point to any URL, but they typically will point to a particular set of **Field Mappings** in Glyue's Build page for **Pre-Mapping**.

A given integration framework will often encompass hundreds of **Field Mappings**. **Bookmarks** are a way to group them by category into manageable collections. Examples of such categories typically grouped into **Bookmarks** are addresses, interest rate fields, or collateral details. By having each **Bookmark** focus on a particular business function or category, the **Pre-Mapping** and **Mapping** phases can progress more quickly and efficiently.

Each Integration template will have a set of **Bookmarks** for the integration and new ones can be added as needed later.

&#x20;In this part of the tutorial, we'll open the **Bookmarks** page and view its contents.

1. Log into Glyue
2. From the first page, hover over the menu icons to expand it and find **Bookmarks**\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (100).png>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png>)
3.  Click on **Bookmarks** to navigate to its page which will look something like this (NOTE: the specific sections for your integration may vary). This page lists the **Bookmark Sections**; a **Section** is a specific collection of **Bookmarks** grouped by a common category:\

4.  To the left of each **Section** with the folder icon is a triangle to expand the view. To the right are buttons for editing and adding new **Bookmarks** which will be explored another time. Click on any of the **Sections** to expand its contents.\

5.  Each **Bookmark** for the **Section** will be listed here with a title/link, description, and tabulation of total rows, comments, and rows whose comments are resolved. Click on one of the links to view its **Field Mapping(s)**.\
    \
    You'll know you've reached the **Field Mapping** portion of the **Build Page** if the **Component** dropdown in the upper left has **Field Mapping** selected.\

{% hint style="info" %}
Suppose you don't see **Field Mapping** in the **Component** menu. In that case, you can go back to Step 4 and select another **Bookmark** (The Sandbox Banking Project Manager or Solutions Engineer can assist if you have trouble identifying the correct Bookmark(s)).\
\
Any time you want to go to a particular **Field Mapping**, you can repeat the steps outlined above.
{% endhint %}

There are typically hundreds of **Field Mappings** across different objects or record types for a given integration. The purpose of **Bookmarks** in the **Pre-Mapping** phase is to break down all of these **Field Mappings** into manageable groups for a particular category or object.

That concludes this part of the Pre-Mapping Tutorial.
