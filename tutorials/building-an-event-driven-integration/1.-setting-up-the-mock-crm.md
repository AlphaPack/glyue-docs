# 1. Setting up the Mock CRM

For this tutorial, we will use a mock CRM built using Glyue's [Frontends feature](../../how-to-guides/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-custom-frontend.md).&#x20;

**Setting up the Mock CRM**

Using the navigation bar, open _Frontends._ Click _Create_ in the top right. Enter the following:

> Name: Mock CRM
>
> Path: mock-crm

Download this `.zip` file that contains the source code for a simple mock CRM:

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/mock_crm.zip" %}

Upload it to your Frontend by dragging the `.zip` file into the _Files_ section on the right side.

Save your frontend by clicking _Create_.



**Finding the Integration URL**

Glyue integrations are exposed via their URL. To get an integration's execution URL, right click on the integration and click _Run Integration._ The top of the **Integration Runner** shows the integration's URL. Copy the URL using the _Copy_ button on the right side.



**Configuring the Mock CRM**

Open the mock CRM by clicking the _View_ button. In the popup window, enter the integration URL you obtained in the previous step.
