# 1. Setting up the Mock CRM

**Preparing the Integration for External HTTP API Access**

Glyue integrations are exposed via their URL. We need to make two changes to our integration to prepare it for external calls. Start by navigating to the **Build page,** right-clicking on the integration, and selecting _Configure_.

1. Remove spaces from the integration's Path Name so it can be used in a URL.\
   Change `User Management (Tutorial)` to `user_management_tutorial`
2. Enable HTTP API access by checking the _Enable API Access_ box.

Click _Save_, then close the modal using the _X_ in the top-right corner.



**Finding the Integration URL**

To get an integration's execution URL, right click on the integration and click _Run Integration._ The top of the **Integration Runner** shows the integration's URL. Copy the URL using the _Copy_ button on the right side and save it.

**Setting up the Mock CRM**

Using the navigation bar, open _Frontends._ Click _Create_ in the top right. Enter the following:

> Name: Mock CRM
>
> Path: mock-crm

Download this `.zip` file that contains the source code for a simple mock CRM:

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/mock_crm.zip" %}

Upload it to your Frontend by dragging the `.zip` file into the _Files_ section on the right side.
