# 3. Triggering the Integration from the CRM

Return to the CRM.

Open the [mock core](https://sandbox.demo-systems.sandboxbanking.com) and familiarize yourself with its current contents. After running the integration, you will see the customer you entered in the CRM appear in the mock core.

Once both systems are open, return to the CRM and click _Send to Core_.

Return to the mock core and verify that the new customer was created in the core.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For simplicity, this integration always creates a new user in the core when run. If you run the integration multiple times with the same input from the CRM, you will see duplicate entires in the mock core.
{% endhint %}

Congratulations! :tada: You have transformed your trigger-based integration into an event-based integration, and demonstrated connectivity between a mock CRM and mock banking core.&#x20;

Over the course of these three tutorials, you have learned to leverage the simple but powerful framework at the heart of Glyue: transforming data using field mappings and connecting systems using service requests. Using the knowledge you learned here, you can now create integrations tailored to your specific systems and needs.

As you grow into more complex integrations, we encourage you to make use of the extensive selection of How-To Guides and Reference Documentation to leverage the full power of Glyue.

Happy building!
