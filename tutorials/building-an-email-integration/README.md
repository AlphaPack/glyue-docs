# Build a Basic Integration

This tutorial aims to guide a first-time Glyue user through the process of building a real integration, step by step, from start to finish. This integration will take an email address as input, then query the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) for articles, and finally email a list of article URLs to the provided address.

Upon completion of the tutorial, the reader will understand:

* integrations, as well as how to build one,
* how to use the Admin site to configure Glyue components,
* how to validate the data that passes through Glyue,
* how to visualize that data at every step,
* how to trigger integrations,

and more generally, the _awesome power of Glyue_!
