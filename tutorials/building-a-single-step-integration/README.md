# Building a Single-Step Integration

In this tutorial, we will build a simple integration that calls out to an external API and displays the response. In doing so, we will work with the **Integration Builder**, the **Integration Configuration Wizard**, and the **Run History** page.

This tutorial will use the [randomuser.me API](https://randomuser.me/documentation), a public API that returns randomly generated user information. This API does not require authentication, making it suitable for our tutorial purposes.
