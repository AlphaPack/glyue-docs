# Service Accounts

Service Accounts are intended to manage third-party system access to Glyue integrations. Service Accounts cannot:

* Log into Glyue
* View or modify integrations
* Invite users to Glyue

When creating a Service Account, you may optionally associate a "vendor" with the account to note the specific third-party system that the account belongs to.

Service Account may be a part of an [organization](organizations.md).&#x20;

_Service Accounts can only be created by Sandbox Banking staff at this time. Please reach out to support@sandboxbanking.com if you wish to add a Service Account._
