# Organizations

Organizations allow multi-tenant Glyue environments to manage the data their customers have access to while sharing the same set of integrations. Members of an organization can view the run histories and [schedules](../integration-scheduler.md) of all members of their organization, but cannot see the run histories generated by members of other organizations.&#x20;

Organizations do **not** impact the [integrations](./#integration-permissions) or [system permissions](./#user-permissions) a user has access to. Those permissions are still governed on a per-account basis, or any [groups](./#group-permissions) the account belongs to.



_Organizations can only be created by Sandbox Banking staff at this time. If you are interested in creating an Organization, reach out to support@sandboxbanking.com_
