Common usage is:

```
# Retrieve value from payload
input.payload.some_value

# Check method on request
if (input.method == "POST"):
    # Do something
    
# Retrieve customer ID from path params
cust_id = input.params["cust_id"]
```

`input` can be referenced in any formula block / lifecycle hook, including the `value` column of a field mapping.&#x20;
