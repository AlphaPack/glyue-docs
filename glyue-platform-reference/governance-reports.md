# Governance Reports

Glyue provides governance reports that details the state of  [integration execution permissions](permissions/#integration-permissions) across all users. The report provides two views:

* **Access Report** shows a list of all currently active permissions for all active users in the system.
* **Permission Log** shows a ledger of all permission changes for the selected timespan. This includes both permission grants and revocations.

The meaning of each column in the report is detailed below:
