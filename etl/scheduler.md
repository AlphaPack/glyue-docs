# Scheduler

Glyue ETL's scheduler operates similarly to [Glyue iPaaS's scheduler](../glyue-platform-reference/integration-scheduler.md).

The only distinction is that due to the _Drafts_ feature in Glyue ETL, the ETL scheduler can only schedule workflows using their _Production_ credentials â€” _Development_ credentials are not permitted.
