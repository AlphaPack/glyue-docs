# Glyue Overview

Glyue is a low-code [iPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based\_integration) for building and running banking integrations.  Banks, credit unions, fintechs, and system integrators use the platform to quickly connect their software.  The platform is designed to create web service APIs, batch ETL jobs, file/document transfer workflows, and event-triggered pub/sub integrations.

Banking leaders, business users, and developers choose Glyue over other integration platforms because of the following key advantages:

* Numerous built-in adapters for banking-specific systems like core processors, loan origination systems, CRMs, KYC/AML providers, etc.
* Extensive catalog of starter templates (i.e. pre-built integrations) for common integration use-cases like loan booking, deposit origination,  IVR/IVA interaction, banking as a service (BaaS) APIs, bulk CRM loading, bulk data mart loading, customer 360 APIs, loan renewals/mods, core processor customer/account maintenance, etc.  Once imported, these can be customized or extended for a specific institution as necessary.
* Convenient UI for specifying integration logic like field mappings, validation rules, etc.
* Security, compliance, and reporting features specific to the banking industry
* The full power of [Python](https://www.python.org/) is available so developers can always deliver!
