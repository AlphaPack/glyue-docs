# Glyue Overview

Glyue is a low-code [iPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based\_integration) for building and running banking integrations.  Banks, credit unions, fintechs, and system integrators use the platform to quickly connect bank and credit union software.

The platform is frequently used to build/host web service APIs, batch ETL jobs, file/document transfer workflows, and event-triggered pub/sub integrations (e.g. web hooks, Kafka streaming data pipelines).

Glyue offers several advantages over generic integration platforms:

* Numerous built-in adapters for banking-specific systems like core processors, loan origination systems, deposit opening systems, CRMs, KYC/AML providers, etc.
* Extensive catalog of starter templates (i.e. pre-built integrations) for common integration use-cases like loan booking, deposit origination,  IVR/IVA interaction, banking as a service (BaaS) APIs, bulk CRM loading, bulk data mart loading, customer 360 APIs, loan renewals/mods, core processor customer/account maintenance, etc.  Once imported, these can be customized or extended for a specific institution as necessary.
* Convenient UI for specifying integration logic like field mappings, validation rules, etc.  Its UX/DX is familiar to those experienced with Excel.
* Security, compliance, and reporting features specific to the banking and credit union industries.

While the platform aspires to be low-code, the full power of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and its ecosystem is available within Glyue!  Consequently, developers always have a way to deliver necessary functionality.

**Whether you're a Glyue newcomer or veteran, this documentation intends to provide all the information you need to make the most of the platform!**
