# Glyue Overview

Glyue is a low-code [iPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based\_integration) for banking.  It enables banks, credit unions, fintechs, and system integrators to quickly connect software.

Certain features make Glyue awesome:

* Numerous built-in adapters for banking-specific systems like core processors, loan origination systems, CRMs, KYC/AML providers, etc.
* Extensive catalog of starter templates (i.e. pre-built integrations) for common integration use-cases like loan booking, deposit origination,  IVR/IVA interaction, banking as a service (BaaS) APIs, bulk CRM loading, bulk data mart loading, customer 360 APIs, loan renewals/mods, core processor customer/account maintenance, etc.  Once imported, these can be customized or extended for a specific institution as necessary.
* Convenient UI for specifying integration logic like field mappings, validation rules, etc.
* Security, compliance, and reporting features specific to the banking industry
* The full power of [Python](https://www.python.org/) is available so developers can always deliver!
