# What is Glyue?

Glyue is a low-code [iPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based\_integration) for building and running banking integrations.  Banks, credit unions, fintechs, and system integrators use the platform to quickly connect bank and credit union software.

The platform can build/host web service APIs, batch ETL jobs, file/document transfer workflows, and event-triggered pub/sub integrations (e.g. web hooks, Kafka streaming data pipelines).

Glyue offers several advantages over generic integration platforms:

* Numerous built-in adapters for banking-specific systems like core processors, loan origination systems, deposit application systems, CRMs, KYC/AML providers, etc.
* Extensive catalog of starter templates (i.e. pre-built integrations) for common integration use-cases like loan booking, deposit origination,  IVR/IVA interaction, banking as a service (BaaS) APIs, bulk CRM loading, bulk data mart loading, customer 360 APIs, loan renewals/mods, core processor customer/account maintenance, etc.  Once imported, these integrations can be customized or extended to fit a specific institution's needs.
* Convenient UI for specifying integration logic like outbound service requests, field mappings, validation rules, etc.  Its UX/DX is familiar to those experienced with Excel.
* Security, compliance, and reporting features specific to the banking and credit union industries.

While the platform offers the speed and convenience of low-code mapping, the full power of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and its ecosystem is available within Glyue.  Consequently, developers are never limited by the platform's built-in functionality.
