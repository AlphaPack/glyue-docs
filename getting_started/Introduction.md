# Introduction

Glyue is a data-driven solution built to integrate API services and other internal processes. It provides a fast and consistent way to take a low-code approach to connecting different API services. Glyue supports both REST and SOAP requests making integrating with a variety of services a breeze.

Many integrations can start with a minimal approach, but Glyue was built to handle complex business logic, data validation, and most importantly data security.
