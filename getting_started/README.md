# Getting Started

Glyue is a data-driven solution built to integrate API services and other internal processes. It provides a fast and consistent way to take a low-code approach to integrations. Whether it is creating RESTful APIs, adding webhook subscriptions, or scheduling batch jobs, Glyue has the flexibility to handle any integration pattern.

Many integrations can start with a minimal approach, but Glyue was built to handle complex business logic, data validation, while maintaining data security.
