# Integration Builder Page

## Main Toolbar

Buttons on the Integration Builder Toolbar enables users to add, duplicate and clear changes within the Builder. The special tool, `deep clone` creates a full copy of the entire Builder Row selected, and all of the children associated with it.

## Filters

### Column

The column filter handles the display status of the Build Page. By default, all columns are shown but each column can be toggled to be hidden.

### Filter

The filter feature highlights matched Builder Rows based on the entered values. It will search in real-time and provide the number of results returned within the button.

### SQL Filter

This performs the back-half of a SQL filter for the table. This allows users to search with higher specificity than the traditional text based filter.

Example Filters

```
FROM * SELECT
```

### Comments

Comments are the main source of communication when jointly working within the Integration Builder. Comments can be created by anyone who has read-access to the integration.

### Tags

Each section of the Integration Builder has the ability to add a `tag` to Builder rows. This provides a way to identify specific pieces of an integration and how they relate. It is particularly helpful when used in combination with Bookmarks.
