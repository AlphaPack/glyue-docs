# How to use the Vault

The Glyue vault feature provides a way for configuration, secrets, and state to be read and written by integrations.

More specifically, it is an API for storing and retrieving JSON in the database, as well as a page in the Glyue application to manage the stored content.



Some useful vault vocabulary:

* A "Vault Item" is a JSON object with a name, it can be read or written by integrations, as well as on the vault page.
* A "Vault Secret" is like a Vault Item, except that it cannot be read on the vault page, only written.
* A "Vault" is a named collection of Vault Items and Secrets



**This guide will explain how to:**

1. Create a vault
2. Create a vault item
3. Configure your integration to have access to the vault
4. Read the vault item in an integration hook



Prerequisites:

* This guide expects you are familiar with the build page and editing integrations
* You must be a superuser or have the "can view vault" permission

## Creating a Vault

First, you must create a "Vault". This allows for your items and secrets to be logically organized.

1\) Navigate to the vault page by clicking the vault icon on the sidebar: ![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

2\) Press the "+ Create Vault" button ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

3\) Name your vault "my-vault" in the modal , then press "Create Vault"

## Creating a Vault Item

Next, we'll create an item in the vault. This is the item your integration will read at runtime.

1\) Select "my-vault" in the leftmost column

2\) Press "+ Create Vault Item" ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

3\) In the modal, provide the name "my-item" for your vault item, and in the text editor, provide some valid JSON.

4\) Press "+ Create Vault Item"

You vault item is now saved, and can be seen on the vault page

## Connecting your integration to the Vault

This step assumes you have an existing integration called "my-integration"

1\) Navigate to the admin page by pressing the profile icon on the top-right of Glyue and select "Admin"![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

2\) On the page that appears, scroll to and click on "+ Add" next to "Vault Permissions"

3\) Fill out the form to give "my-integration" permission to read from "my-vault"

4\) Press save

5\) Return to the Glyue Application by pressing "View Site" on the top-right corner of your screen

## Read the vault within your integration

First - some important concepts about the vault:

A given vault can only be opened by one running integration at a time. If another integration tries to open a vault that is already open, it will halt until the other running integration closes it.

For this reason, it is important to always close a vault when you are done using it. We make this easy by providing a vault context manager (The python 'with' statement)

Here is the code we will be putting into our integration before hook:

```python
with open_vault('my-vault') as vault:
    my_data = vault.get("my-item")
# The with statement automatically closes the vault at this point
debug(my_data, label="Here's what was in the vault")
```

If you do the above, and run your integration, you should see this in your run history

If you want your vault contents to be accessible throughout the rest of your integration (meaning, not just within the before\_hook), you can `keep` my\_data:

```python
with open_vault('my-vault') as vault:
    my_data = vault.get("my-item")
debug(my_data, label="Here's what was in the vault")
keep(my_data = my_data) # my_data can now be accessed in any other hook or expression
```
