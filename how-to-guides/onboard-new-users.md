2. Enter the new user's email and give them a username. The invitation will be sent to this email. \
   \
   Selecting "Staff" in the _Additional Permissions_ dropdown will give the user [Staff permissions](../reference/permissions.md#user-permissions).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're unsure what username to give, we recommend reusing the portion of their email before the @ sign.
{% endhint %}

3. Select the integrations that the user should have access to. You will need to grant each [type of permission](../glyue-technical-reference/integration\_configuration.md#integration-permissions) separately.
