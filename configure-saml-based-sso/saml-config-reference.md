# SAML Config Reference

While the default SAML config settings will suffice for most use cases, changes may be necessary depending on the IdP and/or customer’s requirements.

If changes are made to an existing SAML Config, Glyue’s SAML metadata will change. All connected IdPs will need the updated metadata.

| Attribute map       | <pre><code>{"email": "email"}
</code></pre> | <p>A mapping table (in the format of a JSON object) that maps IdP user attributes (keys) to Glyue user attributes (values). If the name of the attribute for the user’s email address in the IdP is something other than “email” (such as “emailAddress”), this JSON object should be extended to include that mapping:</p><pre><code>{
  "email": "email",
  "emailAddress": "email"
}
</code></pre><p>The user email address in Glyue is simply called “email”.</p><p>Some IdPs allow for mapping user attributes on their end as well.</p><p>Be sure to add the new attribute name to <strong>Required attributes</strong>.</p> |
| Http client timeout | 10                                          | Seconds to wait for a response from an IdP before giving up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Logout http binding | REDIRECT                                    | How Glyue should expect the IdP to send logout requests. REDIRECT is most common but POST is used by some providers. Not all IdPs have this capability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Cert file           | None                                        | A custom certificate and public key for Glyue to use for SAML communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

A key/cert pair is only needed if the IdP or customer requires _additional security_ on top of HTTPS. HTTPS alone is generally considered to be plenty secure for SAML SSO.

| Required attributes                | email | A comma-separated list of user attributes Glyue will require from the IdP. If a custom user attribute is added to the **Attribute map** it should also be added here.                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Want assertions or response signed | True  | Glyue will accept as valid all SAML assertions (login response) from trusted IdPs as long as either the assertion or the outer response containing it, is signed. This is considered secure in SAML standards and should suffice for most cases. If set to True, will override the next two settings. |
| Want assertions signed             | False | Glyue will require SAML assertions to be signed. Automatically set to False if **Want assertions or response signed** is True.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Want response signed               | False | Glyue will require the outer SAML response to be signed. Automatically set to False if **Want assertions or response signed** is True.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Authn requests signed              | False | Glyue will sign its login requests to the IdP, using the cert/key pair. Generally not required.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Force authn                        | False | Requires IdP to authenticate the user directly rather than rely on a previous security context.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
